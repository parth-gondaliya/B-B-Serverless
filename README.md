The Hotel Management component of the application allow registrations, and create invoices considering the stay, food ordered etc. A virtual assistance provides two different types of services, such as basic website navigation, and room availability check by guest users, and managing booking, ordering food by authorized hotel customers. There is an additional service, which is tour operator, and the service will be activated only if a tour is requested. The tour related operations are not part of the application, but is a component, which needs some integration with the actual application. Fig 1 shows an overview of the application.
